                <p>Hi! Please call me Shabrina or Ina. I’m a curious and growth-driven designer with a background in visual arts and organizational experience. After exploring various fields of design, I found my passion in creating meaningful user experiences. As someone with an INFP personality, I’m naturally empathetic, reflective, and highly attuned to people’s needs, which allows me to approach design not only as a visual task, but as a meaningful way to connect with users on a deeper level.  I believe good design starts with listening, and I’m eager to listen, learn, and grow.</p>

                            <p class="subtitle">A UX case study to improve campus digital library experiences for university students</p>
                            <p>According to the Indonesian Higher Education Database (PDDikti), there were 9.32 million active students in Indonesia in 2025. However, only around 1.5 million have used their campus digital library. Nevertheless, many students struggle to find academic resources efficiently. This indicates a gap between the demand for and the actual use of digital libraries in educational environments. This project examines how digital libraries can enhance their service to students by improving accessibility, clarity, and efficiency in locating learning resources.</p>

                            <p class="subtitle">A UX case study about making fashion fit-better for everyone</p>
                            <p>Online clothing shopping has become part of the modern lifestyle, particularly among fashion enthusiasts. However, although practical, this process is often accompanied by uncertainty: "Will the clothes I buy fit my body?". The initial inspiration for this project came from a scene in a drama, where VIP customers do not need to try on clothes one by one, because a model with a similar body has been provided to demonstrate the clothes they are interested in. This idea highlights the value of a personally relevant visual experience and the ability to choose the right fit in the clothing selection process.</p>

                            <p>In many cultural festivals and creative exhibitions, visitors often find themselves overwhelmed — lost in crowds, unsure where to go next, or missing sessions they were looking forward to. On the other side, organizers struggle to deliver real-time information or handle bookings effectively. By focusing on both visitors and organizers, Clevent was designed to make events easier to manage, easier to explore, and ultimately, more enjoyable for everyone involved.</p>
